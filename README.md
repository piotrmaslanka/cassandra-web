Lol wut.

This is [cassandra-web](https://github.com/avalanche123/cassandra-web) but as a Docker container. 

It listens on port 80.

Environment variables to set:

* **HOSTS** - a list of hosts
* **PORT** - a port to connect to, 9042 by default

If you pass anything extras via command, it will be passed to cassandra-web.

Enjoy.
